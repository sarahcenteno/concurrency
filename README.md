# concurrency
This project was completed for my Operating System Concepts class. In this program, it will create a simulation of user programs and the operating system communicating to each other to execute an I/O operation implemented by semaphores. There will be one user that will communicate with the DOIO to request an I/O operation. Then, the DOIO will assemble an IORB to be sent to the device driver. The device driver will initiate the physical I/O operation and then the disk will complete the process.
